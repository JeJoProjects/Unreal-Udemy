# Bulls & Cows Game

It is a simple unreal-terminal based game, where the player will be asked to type in a **[Iosgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram)**.
The minimum UE required: [UE 22.3](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-22-released) and it has been written with [C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17) compiler support. Therefore the compiler flag needs to be updated before compiling the UE Project.

* **The Bulls**: are the number of characters in player's guessed word, which matches in the isogram exactly in the same position.
* **The Cows** : are the number of characters in player's guessed word, which are also in the isogram but not in the exact position.
